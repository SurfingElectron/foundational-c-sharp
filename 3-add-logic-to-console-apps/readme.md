### Evaluate Boolean expressions to make decisions in C# 
My goal was to develop decision statements for various situations by using Boolean expressions and C# operators.

Using various operators and techniques, I wrote code that evaluated equality, compared values to see if one was greater or less than (or equal to) the other. I compared strings, massaging them to create a more accurate comparison that eliminated issues like casing and spaces that might interfere with the result I were hoping for. I learned how to use logical negation to flip a value for comparison, and used the result of methods in my Boolean expressions. Finally, I used the conditional operator to succinctly evaluate a condition and return a result.

### Control variable scope and logic using code blocks in C#
My goal was to understand how code blocks impact access to variables and the actions required to ensure that variables are appropriately scoped, initialized, and accessible when needed within an application.

I explored the impact of declaring variables inside and outside the boundaries of a code block. I also examined the impact that variable initialization can have on accessibility, as well as how removing unnecessary code blocks can affect code readability.

### Branch the flow of code using the switch-case construct in C#
My goal was to add branching logic that matches one variable or expression against many possible values.

Using the switch-case construct, I matched an employee's numeric level with their title. I used the switch-case as a replacement for the *if-elseif-else* construct to more succinctly express my intent of converting a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) into a long-form description.

C# developers use if and switch selection statements, along with conditional operators, to branch their code. The experience I've gained using selection statements enables me to choose the best C# tool for expressing your intent in my code.

### Iterate through a code block using *for* statement in C#
My goal was to gain additional control over the iteration process by implementing the *for* statement in my code. Modifying the initializer, condition, and iterator of a *for* statement provides precise control over the iteration logic.

Using the *for* statement, I iterated a hard-coded number of times, and used the Length on an array to iterate through the code block once for each item in the array. I modified the iterator, the condition for exiting the loop, and the pattern for iteration. I used the break keyword to exit out of the loop's body prematurely. Without the iteration control provided by the *for* statement, I wouldn't be able to complete certain coding tasks, such as looping through the data in a multidimensional array.

### Add looping logic to your code using the *do-while* and *while* statements in C#
My goal was to use the *do-while* and *while* statements to perform iterations. The *do-while* and *while* statements are unique because the body of the code block determines whether the flow of execution should continue or stop.

Using the *do-while* statement, you executed a block of code once before evaluating a Boolean expression and potentially exiting the iteration. Using the *while* statement, you performed the evaluation of the Boolean expression immediately, and continued to evaluate it to exit the iteration. You used the continue statement within the code block to step directly to the Boolean expression.

I developed a practical application that uses the *do-while* and continue statements to simulate a battle in a role playing game. Real-world scenarios involving the *do-while* and while iteration statements involve working with streams of data from files, from the internet, or any other scenario where you'll continue to perform an iteration until a condition is met.
