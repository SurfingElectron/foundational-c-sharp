### Evaluate Boolean expressions to make decisions in C# 
My goal was to develop decision statements for various situations by using Boolean expressions and C# operators.

Using various operators and techniques, I wrote code that evaluated equality, compared values to see if one was greater or less than (or equal to) the other. I compared strings, massaging them to create a more accurate comparison that eliminated issues like casing and spaces that might interfere with the result I were hoping for. I learned how to use logical negation to flip a value for comparison, and used the result of methods in my Boolean expressions. Finally, I used the conditional operator to succinctly evaluate a condition and return a result.

### Control variable scope and logic using code blocks in C#
My goal was to understand how code blocks impact access to variables and the actions required to ensure that variables are appropriately scoped, initialized, and accessible when needed within an application.

I explored the impact of declaring variables inside and outside the boundaries of a code block. I also examined the impact that variable initialization can have on accessibility, as well as how removing unnecessary code blocks can affect code readability.

### Branch the flow of code using the switch-case construct in C#
My goal was to add branching logic that matches one variable or expression against many possible values.

Using the switch-case construct, I matched an employee's numeric level with their title. I used the switch-case as a replacement for the if-elseif-else construct to more succinctly express my intent of converting a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) into a long-form description.

C# developers use if and switch selection statements, along with conditional operators, to branch their code. The experience I've gained using selection statements enables me to choose the best C# tool for expressing your intent in my code.
