# Create and run simple C# console applications (Get started with C#, Part 2)
## Topics
### Install and configure Visual Studio Code 
My goal was to install and configure an integrated development environment that meets my coding requirements for C#.

I had already installed Visual Studio Code for other projects in other programming languages. I was able to configure extensions that make Visual Studio Code an even more powerful tool for C# code development. I also installed the .NET SDK to provide .NET Class Library support and support for .NET command line interface commands.

### Call methods from the .NET Class Library using C#
My goal was to call methods defined in the .NET Class Library to perform tasks like generating a random number or performing a mathematical operation.

Using C# syntax, I called different kinds of methods in the .NET Class Library: methods that returned values, methods that accepted multiple input parameters, and methods that maintained state. I used Visual Studio Code IntelliSense and docs.microsoft.com to research methods, and to improve my understanding of what a method does and how it works.

### Add decision logic to your code using 'if', 'else', and 'else if' statements in C#
My goal in this module was to add branching logic to my code by using decision statements.

Using if, else if, and else statements, I evaluated Boolean expressions to create alternative execution paths through my application. This allowed me to execute some code and ignore other code, depending on some condition. Without decision statements, my applications would lack the ability to automate common business, gaming, and scientific tasks required in modern applications.

### Store and Iterate Through Sequences of Data Using Arrays and the foreach Statement in C#
My goal in this module was to work with a sequence of Order IDs programmatically to identify potentially fraudulent orders. I created an array of Order IDs, then iterated through each element of the sequence looking for a common fraud trait.

Arrays enabled me to store each Order ID as an element of a single variable. I addressed a specific element of the array using an index -- a zero-based numeric value. I were able to retrieve and set the value of each element. I iterated through the elements of the array to inspect or output each element's value.

### Guided project - Develop foreach and if-elseif-else structures to process array data in C#
My goal was to build an application that uses a combination of iteration and selection statements to process the contents of arrays and achieve the design goals of my application.

By creating a nested combination of foreach and if statements, I built an application that processes the contents of student name and assignment score arrays to calculate and report student grades. The application logic supports adding additional students and assignment scores with minimal code updates.

Having the ability to implement nested iteration statements that process array data, and selection statements that branch the code execution path, enables me to create more efficient and extensible code.
