# Foundational C# with Microsoft

## Topics
### Write your first C# code
The goal was to write code which displayed simple messages to an output console while familiarizing myself with the syntax. I wrote my first lines of code using basic C# syntax. I learned two techniques for displaying literal-string data to the console. I also learned what to look for when I come across an error in my code. And lastly, I identified C# syntax elements like classes and methods, and the purpose of several special symbols that are known as operators. 

### Store and retrieve data using literal and variable values in C#
My goal was to display a formatted message using a combination of literal and variable values.

Using basic C# syntax, I created literal values of several different data types. I declared variables, and also set and retrieved values from those variables. I also initialized variables, and learned how to use the var keyword to implicitly type a variable by inferring the type from the initialization.

## Notes
### Floating-point, double, and decimal data type precision
Float Type  |  Precision     |    Suffix
------------|----------------|----------
float       | ~6-9 digits    |    f
double      | ~15-17 digits  |  (none)
decimal     |  28-29 digits  |    m

### Var
In C#, variables are assigned a type by the compiler regardless of whether you use the actual data type name or allow the compiler to imply the data type. In other words, the type is locked in at the time of declaration and therefore will never be able to hold values of a different data type.
